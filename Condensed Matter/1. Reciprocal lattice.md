If there is any distribution with the symmetry of the Bravais lattice
$$
f({\bf x})=f({\bf x+R})
$$
Then its Fourier transform fulfils
$$
f({\bf r})=\sum_{\bf q}f({\bf q})e^{i{\bf q\cdot x}}=
\sum_{\bf q}f({\bf q})e^{i{\bf q\cdot (x+R)}}
$$
which imples
$$
{\bf q\cdot R}=2\pi n, n\in\mathbb{Z}.
$$
This condition defines the **reciprocal lattice** means that the Fourier transform of a distribution with Bravais lattice symetry depends only the vectors of reciprocal lattice.
Vectors of reciprocal lattice in 3D:
$$
{\bf b}_1=\frac{2\pi}{V_0}{\bf a}_2\times {\bf a}_3,\;\;\;V_0={\bf a}_3\cdot({\bf a}_1\times{\bf a}_2)
$$
In 2D square and 1D:
$$
{\bf b_i} = 2\pi \frac{{\bf a}_i}{|{\bf a}_i|^2}
$$
Wigner-Seitz cell is constructed by making a line connecting a lattice point to each of its, neighbours, constructing planes perpendicular to these lines in the middle of each of them, and making an union of sections of the planes contained between their intersections with other planes.
The Wigner-Seitz primitive unit cell of the reciprocal lattice is the **first Brillouin zone**.
The probability amplitude for elastic scattering of a photon from a potential with the same symmetry as the Bravais lattice is (in the first Born approximation)
$$
\langle{\bf k}_f|V({\bf r})|{\bf k_i}\rangle=
\int d^3r \,e^{-i({\bf k}_f--{\bf k}_i)\cdot{\bf r}}V({\bf r})
$$
which is a Fourier transform of a potential with this symmetry, so ${\bf k}_f--{\bf k}_i$ must belong to the reciprocal lattice - **von Laue condition**.
