#### Mean field approximation
In the Ising model,
$$
H_J=\frac{2J}{\hbar^2}\sum_{\rangle ij\langle}{\bf S}^Z_i{\bf S}^Z_j,
$$
we can consider mean magnetic field generated by average spin,
$$
{\bf H}^Z_e=\frac{2J_0}{g_mu_B\hbar}\langle{\bf S_i^Z}\rangle.
$$
Then, adding also some external field ${\bf H}^Z$, we can write the mean field Hamiltonian as
$$
H_{MF}[{\bf H}^Z]=-\frac{g\mu_B}{\hbar}
\sum_i{\bf S}^Z_i\cdot[{\bf H}^Z+{\bf H}^Z_e].
$$
The partition function and the free energy can be easily found, remembering that the eigenvalues of the spin are $\pm\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
$$
Z[{\bf H}^Z]=\left\lbrace
2\cosh\left[
\frac{g\mu_B}{2k_BT}[{\bf H}^Z_e+{\bf H}^Z]
\right]
\right\rbrace^N,
$$
$$
F[{\bf H}^Z]=-Nk_BT\ln
2\cosh\left[
\frac{g\mu_B}{2k_BT}[{\bf H}^Z_e+{\bf H}^Z]
\right].
$$
Magnetisation can be calculated as ${\bf M}^Z=-\frac{\partial F}{\partial{\bf H}^Z}|_{{\bf H}^Z=0}$, or as being proportional to average spin and thus magnetic field. From this one gets a transcendent equation:
$$
x=\tanh\gamma x,
$$
where $x=\frac{1}{N}\frac{2}{g\mu_B}{\bf M}^Z$ and $\gamma=\frac{zJ}{2\kBT}$, $z$ is the coordination number (number of nearest neighbours.) Non-trivial solutions $x_0\neq 0$ exist for $\gamma>1$, so there is a critical temperature (Curie temperature) $T_C=\frac{zJ}{2k_B}$.
By expanding the hyperbolic function in $T_C/T$ below $T_C$, one can find the solution
$$
{\bf M}^Z(T)=M_0\left(\frac{T_C-T}{T_C}\right)^{1/2}
$$
which is a power law characteristic for a **critical behaviour**.
#### Correlation length
Connected spin correlation function is defined as
$$
-\left.\frac{\partial^2F}{\partial{\bf H}^Z_i\partial{\bf H}^Z_j}\right|_{{\bf H}^Z=0}=
\frac{\lambda^2}{k_BT}\left[
\langle{\bf S}^Z_i{\bf S}^Z_j\rangle-
\langle{\bf S}^Z_i\rangle\langle{\bf S}^Z_j\rangle
\right]=
\frac{\lambda^2}{k_BT}
\langle{\bf S}^Z_i{\bf S}^Z_j\rangle_C,
$$
where $\lambda=\frac{g\mu_B}{\hbar}$.
Using expressions for the magnetisation and for the correlated function, one can Tauylor expand $F[{\bf H}^Z]$. One neglects terms higher than quadratic and requires stability condition $\partial F/\partial {\bf H}_i^Z=0$, which gives:
$$
\langle{\bf S}^Z({\bf R_i})\rangle=\frac{\lambda}{k_BT}
\sum_{{\bf R}_j}\langle{\bf S}^Z({\bf R_i}){\bf S}^Z({\bf R_j})\rangle_C
{\bf H}^Z_j.
$$
This is the **linear response regime**. This expression can be generalised to time-dependent correlation and Fourier transformed to get
$$
\langle{\bf S}^Z({\bf k},\omega)\rangle=\frac{\lambda}{k_BT}
\langle{\bf S}^Z{\bf S}^Z\rangle_C({\bf k},\omega)
{\bf H}^Z({\bf k},\omega),
$$
where the proportionality constant
$$
\chi_{ZZ}({\bf k},\omega)=\frac{\lambda}{k_BT}
\langle{\bf S}^Z{\bf S}^Z\rangle_C({\bf k},\omega)
$$
is the **magnetic susceptibility**.
#### Magnetism of itinerant electrons
One relaxes the Gutzwiller projection condition and applies the mean field approximation: $n_{i,\sigma}\rightarrow\langle n_{i,\sigma}\rangle\rightarrow\langle n_{\sigma}\rangle$. The resulting Hamiltonian can be Fourier transformed and diagonalised to get
$$
H_U=\sum_{\bf k}\sum_\sigma E_\sigma({\bf k})c^\dagger_{{\bf k},\sigma}c_{{\bf k},\sigma}
$$
with the eigenvalues
$$
E_\sigma({\bf k})=E_n({\bf k})+U\langle n_\sigma\rangle
$$
One then defines
$$
m=\langle n_\uparrow\rangle-\langle n_\downarrow\rangle,\;
n=\langle n_\uparrow\rangle+\langle n_\downarrow\rangle,\;

$$
so
$$
E_\pm({\bf k})=E_n({\bf k})+\frac{U}{2}n\pm\frac{m}{2}.
$$
Now
$$
m=\langle n(E_+({\bf k}))\rangle-\langle n(E_-({\bf k}))\rangle,
$$
where $n(E_\sigma({\bf k}))$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution. The two above equations form a **self-consistent** system, which for $T<T_C$ has a solution for $m$ given implicitly by
$$
\frac{k_BT}{E_F}=\frac{\pi}{2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}
\left(\frac{U}{N}g(E_F)-1\right)},
$$
where now $g(E)$ is the is the conduction band density of states at energy E. A condition that must be satisfied: $\frac{U}{N}g(E_F)>1$ is called **Stoner criterion**.
#### Strongly correlated systems
In the Hubbard model Hamiltonian,
$$
H_U=-t\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle,\sigma}
\left[c_{i,\sigma}^\dagger c_{j,\sigma}+c_{j,\sigma}^\dagger c_{i,\sigma}\right]
+U\sum_in_{i,\uparrow}n_{i,\downarrow},
$$
One can assume $U\gg1$, and treat the other term as a perturbation. One defines the ground state by the equation
$$
\sum_i\left(n_{i,\uparrow}+n_{i,\downarrow}\right)|0\rangle=|0\rangle.
$$
It describes the state of the system in the half-filled situation. For the unperturbed part of the Hamiltonian, $H_{U}^{(0)}|0\rangle=0$ due to Pauli principle, so the unperturbed ground state energy $E_0^{(0)}=0$. The first order correction to the ground state energy:
$$
E_0^{(0)}=\langle0|H_U^{I}|0\rangle=0.
$$
This is because $H_U^I|0\rangle=|1\rangle$, where $|1\rangle$ has at least one empty and one doubly occupied site, which means that it is orthogonal to $|0\rangle$, $\langle0|1\rangle=0$.
The second order correction is
$$
E_0^{(2)}=\sum_{n\neq0}\frac{\langle0|H_U^I|n\rangle\langle n|H_U^I|1\rangle}{E_0-E_n},
$$
where $\lbrace|n\rangle\rbrace$ form a complete set of unperturbed Hamiltonian states. Because $E_0=0$, and $H_U^I|1\rangle=U|1\rangle$, so $E_1=U$ and by the orthogonality, only terms with $n=1$ will eventually contribute to the above expression, one can write
$$
E_0^{(2)}=
-\frac{1}{U}\sum_{n\neq0}\langle0|H_U^I|n\rangle\langle n|H_U^I|1\rangle=
-\frac{1}{U}\sum_{n}\langle0|H_U^I|n\rangle\langle n|H_U^I|1\rangle=
-\frac{1}{U}\langle0|H_U^IH_U^I|1\rangle.
$$
Inserting, one has:
$$
E_0^{(2)}=
-\frac{2t^2}{U}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}\sum_{\sigma,\sigma'}
\langle0|
c_{i.\sigma}^\dagger c_{j.\sigma} 
c_{j.\sigma'}^\dagger c_{i.\sigma'}
|1\rangle.
$$
We can use now
$$
H_J=j\sum_{\sigma,\sigma'}
c_{1.\sigma}^\dagger c_{2.\sigma} 
c_{2.\sigma'}^\dagger c_{1.\sigma'}=
-\frac{2J}{\hbar^2}{\bf S}_1\cdot{\bf S}_2.
$$
And we get (with $\hbar=1$):
$$
E_0^{(2)}=
\langle0|
\frac{4t^2}{U}\sum_{\langle i,j\rangle}
{\bf S}_1\cdot{\bf S}_2
|0\rangle.
$$
Therefore, in this regime, the dynamics of electrons described by the Hubbard model become effectively governed by antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian with $J=-2t^2/U<0$.
With the antiferromagnetic background, the effective lattice determining the elctronic properties gets increased twice, so the effective primitive reciprocal vectors get halved.
This can turn half-filled first Brillouin zone into a fully filled one, that is, turn metal into insulator.
#### Electrical conductivity
By using the minimal coupling prescription,
$$
\nabla\rightarrow\nabla+i\frac{e}{\hbar c}{\bf A},
$$
one can turn the free electron Hamiltonian into the one of electron interacting with the field, and the free electron current operator into electric current operator. One can also express the latter as:
$$
{\bf J}=e{\bf j}+\frac{e^2}{mc}\rho{\bf A}.
$$
Following the same path as for magnetic susceptibility, one can get electrical conductivity,
$$
\sigma^{ij}=
\frac{i}{\omega}
\left[
\langle{\bf j}^i{\bf j}^j\rangle 
c({\bf k},\omega)
+\delta^{ij}\frac{ne^2}{mc}
\right]=
\frac{i}{\omega}
\langle{\bf J}^i{\bf J}^j\rangle 
c({\bf k},\omega).
$$
This is known as the **Kubo formula**.
