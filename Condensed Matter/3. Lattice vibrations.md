Acoustic phonons have $\omega(k\rightarrow0)=0$, optical phonons, $\omega(k\rightarrow0)=\omega_0\neq 0$. The latter dominate the low-temperature behaviour of the specific heat. Debye, modelled them as $\omega_s({\bf k}_i)=c_s|{\bf k}_i|$. But ${\bf k}_i$ can have only belong to the first Brillouin zone and their number depends on $N$. So there is limiting frequency $\omega_D$ - Debye frequency.

In a neutron scatterng experiment, Hamiltonian is
$$
H_T=\frac{{\bf P}_N^2}{2M_N}+\sum_{\bf R}V({\bf X}_N-({\bf R+r(R)}))+H,
$$
where quantities with index $N$ refer to the neutron, the sum is over the Bravais lattice, and $H$ is the harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian.

The Hamiltonian must commute with the combined translation operators for the neutron,
$$
T({\bf R}_0)=e^{-\frac{i}{\hbar}{\bf P}_N\cdot{\bf R}_0},
$$and for the crystal,
$$
\tau({\bf R}_0)=e^{-i{\bf K}_l\cdot{\bf R}_0},
$$where
$$
{\bf K}_l=\sum_{{\bf k},s}{\bf k}a_s^\dagger({\bf k})a_s({\bf k})
$$($s$ enumerates three modes, $x,y,z$).

The composite eigenvalue of both translations must be conserved in any process. For neutron scattering with initial and final momenta ${\bf p}_i$ and ${\bf p}_f$ one must have
$$
\exp\left\lbrace-i\left(\frac{{\bf p}_i}{\hbar}+
\sum_{{\bf k}, s}n_i({\bf k}_,s){\bf k}\right)\cdot{\bf R}_0\right\rbrace=
\exp\left\lbrace-f\left(\frac{{\bf p}_i}{\hbar}+
\sum_{{\bf k}, s}n_f({\bf k}_,s){\bf k}\right)\cdot{\bf R}_0\right\rbrace.
$$
It follows that
$$
\frac{{\bf p}_f}{\hbar}-\frac{{\bf p}_i}{\hbar}={\bf Q}-
\sum_{{\bf k}, s}\Delta n({\bf k}_,s){\bf k}.
$$
This give von Laue condition whtn $\Delta n=0$, otherwise phonons are either created or absorbed.
