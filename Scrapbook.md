Niklas:
- QCD-Phase-Diagram -> QCD phase diagram
- neutron star mergers which provides -> neutron star mergers, which provides
- an meaningful -> a meaningful
- the relevant nuclear Equation-Of-State - and which nuclear Equation-Of-State is irrelevant>
- "in order to constrain astrophysical phenomena" - first: it sounds that experiments at HADES will prevent supernovae from exploding, second: I think that studying the EoS is of fundamental importance, not just to help astrophysics
- "various aspects" - one has to say aspects of what
- "encode (...) information from the early stages and therefore the evolution" - maybe in a more broad context we should agree on the wording: early stages? They are for sure earlier-than-freeze-out, but for me "early" is what comes at the beginning and as such is strongly associated with "pre-equilibrium", which we prefer to subtract rather than attempt to get some information from it. 
- In any case, I would avoid "therefore" between "early stages" and "evolution"
